# meteorite-dashboard

This is a collaborative project undertaken by Aydan Nankoosingh, Ekamjit Deol and myself.  Our goal was a develop a full stack web application that emphasizes interactive visualizations.  We decided to use a source from the Meteorological Society, which is a compilation of data on meteorites that have fallen to Earth. You can check out the original [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/meteorite-landings)  Note that during data cleaning, we opted to restrict the data uploaded to the database meteorites that had been recorded falling (not simply later found) due to much more complete documentation of their features.  Our web app pulls data from the PostgreSQL database we populated and then visualizes it. 

* Currently working on updating from Mapbox classic styles due to depreceation
