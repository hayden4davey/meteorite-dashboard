# meteorite-dashboard

This is a collaborative project undertaken by Aydan Nankoosingh, Ekamjit Deol and myself.  Our goal was a develop a full stack web application that emphasizes interactive visualizations.  We decided to use a source from the Meteorological Society, which is a compilation of data on meteorites that have fallen to Earth. You can check out the original CSV [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/meteorite-landings)  Our web app pulls data from a SQL database we populated and then visualizes it.
